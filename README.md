The current status is described in the console logs, so you have real-time access to information about the activities performed.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test

Currently it works on Linux, Mac and Windows systems with Chrome version >=86.

It's just first version of fut web app bot. The project will be further developed and new features will appear.

Good luck!
